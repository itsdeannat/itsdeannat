<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Deanna</h1>

I'm a technical writer with experience in using docs-as-code and topic-based authoring approaches to writing and managing documentation.

Before I became a technical writer, I taught developmental writing at various colleges in Ohio. And before that, I studied linguistics for six years. My work as a Technical Writer blends my years of experience as an English teacher, working with learners of all ages, and an interest in programming!
